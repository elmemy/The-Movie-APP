# The-Movie


The Movie app is the application to show films like popular and top-rated movies and show your favourite. In addition to that, you can favourite the film and it shows locally without using the internet. Moreover. you can make sorting. The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated or by favourites.


I use the design pattern MVP (View - Model - Interactor - Router - Presenter - Configurator)

In addition to that. I use some third-party frameworks like 
- Alamofire to make the network requests.
- Kingfisher to show Images and make caching to the image.
- RealmSwift to save films includes information such as a backdrop image, tagline, original title, short description.
- Localize-Swift to make localization to another language easier.
